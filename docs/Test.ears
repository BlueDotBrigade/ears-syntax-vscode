## EARS Requirements

The software shall support using different types of expressions (text, alias, and moniker) within the same filter.

When an include filter is applied, the software shall display all matching records in the results. 

While a record is pinned, the software shall always display the pinned record in the results, regardless of any filters that are applied.

While the "tail" option is selected, when a new log entry is written, the software shall refresh the display automatically.

If a log file is corrupted, then software shall display "File corruption detected".

RISK: corrupted files may be problematic.
