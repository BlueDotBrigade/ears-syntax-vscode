# VS Code Extension: EARS Syntax

## Overview

The `EARS Syntax` extension for _Visual Studio Code_ aims to make your experience of writing EARS ([Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax][alistairmavin]) requirements as smooth as possible. This extension offers syntax highlighting and code completion through snippets for various EARS requirement patterns, helping both technical and business stakeholders draft clear, unambiguous requirements.

## Features

### Syntax Highlighting

- Automatically highlights EARS patterns and keywords to improve readability and focus.
  
### Code Completion

- Use intelligent snippets to quickly insert EARS patterns, such as "When [trigger], the system shall [response]."
  
## Installation

1. Open VS Code.
2. Go to the Extensions view by clicking the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window.
3. Search for `EARS Syntax`.
4. Click the Install button.

## Usage

- Once installed, the syntax highlighting is automatically applied to `.ears` or `.txt` files where EARS requirements are written.
  
- To use code completion, start typing an EARS pattern and the snippet suggestions will appear. Simply select the desired snippet and it will auto-complete the sentence structure for you.

## Configuration

No additional configuration is required to use this extension. However, you can modify your VS Code settings to better suit your needs.
